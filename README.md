# My projects for the Machine Learning Engineering nanodegree
----

This repo aims to be a portfolio of my work during the Machine Learning
nanodegree of Udacity. I am very glad that I have enrolled in this project as I
got to explore the fundamentals in all areas of machine learning: supervised,
unsupervised, reinforcement, and deep learning fundamentals.  
The assignments really prepare you for the work environment in this field. They
were challenging, but overall, they made me a better researcher. Here is a brief
description of the projects that you can find in this repository:

### Project 1: Predicting Boston Housing Prices
----
For this project, I've built a machine learning algorithm to predict the best
selling price of a house in Boston. The dataset for this project originates
from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The Boston housing data was collected
in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features
for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. The final implementation
required to train a model using the decision tree algorithm. To ensure that I am
using an optimal model, I've trained the model using the grid search technique
to optimize the 'max_depth' parameter for the decision tree.

### Project 2: Find Donors for CharityML
The objective of this project was to help CharityML, a fictitious charity
organization, to build an algorithm to best identify potential
donors and reduce overhead cost of sending mail. My task was to evaluate and
optimize several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm
will provide the highest donation yield while also reducing the total number
of letters being sent.

### Project 3: Creating Customer Segments
In this project I have implemented unsupervised learning techniques on product spending data collected for
customers of a wholesale distributor in Lisbon, Portugal to identify customer segments hidden in the
data.

### Project 4: Smartcab
The goal of this project was to construct an optimized Q-Learning driving agent that can navigate a Smartcab through its environment towards a goal: drive passengers from one location to another. The driving agent was evaluated on two important metrics: safety and reliability.

### Project 5: Multidigit recognition
For this project I have designed and implemented a deep learning model that learns to recognize sequences of digits, using the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset.

### Capstone project: Diabetic retinopathy detection
For my capstone project, I've decided to work on diabetic retinopathy detection using deep learning. This project was based on the data provided by a [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection/data) held on Kaggle. My final model used a convolutional neural network and data augmentation techniques in order to improve the precision of the model.
